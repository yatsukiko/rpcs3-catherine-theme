# Catherine theme based on Anileo's YoRHa theme https://github.com/AniLeo
you need to aqcuire the background picture by yourself, if you have catherine classic with extras it's in "Steam\steamapps\common\CatherineClassic\EXTRAS\DESKTOP WALLPAPERS\3840X2160\CATH_DLUX_DESK_WALLPAPER_1_3840X2160_V3.jpg"
I'm guessing all pictures with violet/pink colour scheme will work
